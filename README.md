This is an election result relay tool that you can deploy to record and relay the results of the general election at the polling station in August. All this is in real-time. It has a practical vote entry Google form and a dashboard-style results sheet. 

For candidates that want to make sure that votes are counted/tallied correctly, their agents stay with the ballot box as the votes are counted. They then relay the results parallel to the IEBC results where their candidate and supporters can view them in real-time via a web interface.
The Constitution provides that at every election, the IEBC shall ensure that the results from the polling stations are openly and accurately collated and promptly announced by the returning officer. It also provides that in a presidential election, after counting the votes in the polling
stations, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission shall tally and verify the count and declare the result, and with the inspiration from that, I prepared this Election Relay tool.

Votes entry Form Access Control

Nowadays, security is a major concern. There are various methods for authentication. The vote entry form requires a password set by the admin to prevent unauthorised access
Also, the form only accepts a single entry,- the first, which will be displayed on the dashboard to avoid manipulation, though further entries will be recorded with different timestamps which can be audited later.

This tool consists of two pages. The page you see above is the “Results” page. It is a web interface that gives you a visualized summary of the election results. There is little information that is needed to be filled in (by the admin) like Election name (Position/Seat) and the party name. The rest of the data comes from the votes entry google form.
I designed the votes sheet (second sheet) from a google form. I locked them with data validation so you can only input “numerical figures” into the boxes. It counts all votes for each candidate in realtime and lets you see the progress. The results sheet also is updated as you input votes into this form.
